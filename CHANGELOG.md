# Change Log

All notable changes to the "ipython" extension will be documented in this file.

## 2022-05-29

- Initial release (forked from
  [hoangKnLai/vscode-ipython](https://github.com/hoangKnLai/vscode-ipython))
- Install various tunable delays so code can be sent to the terminal (rather
  than using the `%run` magic command)
- Option to have a different terminal per file.
